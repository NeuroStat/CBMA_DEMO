# CBMA_DEMO
Demonstration of Coordinate Based Meta-Analyses in fMRI.

Welcome at the mini-workshop to execute a coordinate based meta-analysis with fMRI data!
In this tutorial, we will only focus on the software algorithms (no in depth theoretical guidelines with respect to literature search, handling publication bias, etc...). 

We will try to reproduce an existing meta-analysis about social decission making in the brain.

Have fun!
